# Coffee-Machine-OOP

A program for a coffee machine which asks the user which coffee they want. After they select their drink, it asks the customer to insert coins and gives them the change. If the resources are not sufficient, it gives the customers a report stating which ingredients are not enough. Additionally the program gives a report listing water/milk/coffee/money currently available. The following inputs can be given to the program:

1. report: Gives report about all available ingredients available
2. latte/espresso/cappuccino: The drink that you want to buy
3. off: Turns off the machine
